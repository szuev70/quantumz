# quantumz
a module for quantum computing emulations

The QuantumZ package contains the set of functions to emulate quantum computations on the classical computers. The quantum states are supposed to be presented as dictionaries in the form {'|01>': 0.717, '|11>': 0.717} (for example). The same notation is used for the quantum gates.

All functions are described in the source code.
